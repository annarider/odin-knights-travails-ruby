The Odin Project: Knights Travails

Let's plan and outline first before writing code. How does this structure look? 

Board class
- generate 8 x 8 chess board
- generate Binary Search Tree 
-- tree contains all possible paths from any square on the chess board
- pick a search algorithm to calculate the shortest distance from start to end destination
-- same algorithm I used for balanced BST project to calculate the height?

Knight class
- contains logic for valid moves
- saves previously visited squares

 main.rb
- instantiate new knight object
- instantiate new board object
